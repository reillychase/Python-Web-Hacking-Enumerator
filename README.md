# Python-Web-Hacking-Enumerator
This script takes in a list of hosts (from a Sublist3r.py scan for example), and then groups them by IP address

This is how I kick off web application pen tests, it helps sort domains to see which ones are on the same server. 

## Why use it?
For example, you find out there is a subdomain named "test" that is on the same server as \<insert-high-value-target-here\>, then you can figure out where to spend your time faster.
